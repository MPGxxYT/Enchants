# Enchants Project

This project is to create an Explosive enchant and make it function on a pickaxe (though it can be adjusted for all tools).



## Commands

```
/customenchant <enchant> <level>
alias: /cench
```

The enchants can be tabbed. 
Currently can only be applied to pickaxes, but that can easily be changed to support all tools.

When you break a block with a pickaxe that has Explosive (level), it'll blow up a sphere around the block you broke.
